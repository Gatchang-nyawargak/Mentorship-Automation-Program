        In the  first two  chapters of "Born a Crime" by Trevor  Noah Noah talks  about
        his  life growing up in South Africa  during apartheid.  Apartheid was a system 
        that separated  people  based on their race, Trevor  was born to a black mother, 
        and a white father. This was a  problem in South Africa, where mixed-race people
        were discriminated against.The book talks about the  difficulties Trevor and his
        family faced because of  apartheid. Trevor faced a  lot of challenges but he was 
        able to deal with the tough situations  he faced, and his family stayed together 
        and supported each other through  everything.  The book also talks about identity 
        and belonging, which means feeling like you fit in somewhere.Because of apartheid
        it was tough for Trevor to feel like he belonged anywhere. But he found support in 
        his family and his religion.

        <b>Issues in the book;</b>
        
        Discrimination: Trevor and his family faced discrimination because they were 
        black and had to pay black tax, they were not even allowed to go to the white 
        man's estate, and all the black people were left to stay in Soweto.In my county, 
        there is discrimination such that there are services that are accessed by some 
        people and others don't get to access them.

        Economic Inequalities: Trevorâ€™s mother faced economic inequalities when there were
        secluded jobs for the black people where black people only had cleaning jobs this 
        relates to my county in that there are specific tribes that get to have good jobs.
